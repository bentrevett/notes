# Contrastive Learning

Contrastive learning is a [[representation_learning]] technique.

The general concept is that the model should learn representations so that similar inputs should have similar representations and dissimilar inputs should have dissimilar representations.

Contrastive learning is used by [[siamese_neural_network]] models as well as algorithms such as [[simCLR]] and [[CURL]].
