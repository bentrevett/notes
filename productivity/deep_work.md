# Harsh Truths

There are two types of winners in this world:

- Those who works creatively with intelligent machines
- Rock-stars in their fields

There are also two core abilities that these winners have:

- Ability to quickly master hard things
- Ability to produce stuff quickly

You need to push your skills to the limit. If you don't produce anything, you won't thrive no matter how talented you are.

**Deep work** is work done in long, uninterrupted chunks.

**Deep work** lets you quickly master hard things.

**Deep work** helps you produce at an elite level.

# Focus

Deliberate practice cannot work alongside distraction. Do not confuse busyness with productivity. Your world is the outcome of what you pay attention to and focusing on work takes your attention away from the unpleasant things in life. Focus on the end goal - "we who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals". 

Focus on the important. The more you attempt to do, the less you actually accomplish. Execution should be aimed at a small number of important goals. Have a specific goal with tanglible and substantial professional benefits. Once you have your goal, you need to measure success. You can do this with two measures:

- L*ag measures* - something you can trying to improve in the long term
- L*ead measures* - new behaviours that drive lag measures

Your lead measure should be time spent doing **deep work** toward an important goal.

# Rituals

We need routines and rituals as we only have a finite amount of willpower. Rituals require planning, such as:

- Where
- How long
- How you will work (internet ban, target wpm)
- How to support your work (start with tea, plan breaks)

Potentially make big gestures, such as spending money on an expensive item for productivity, which will force you to do work.

Keep a physical measure of performance (hours of **deep work**), such as ticks on a page. Whenevr a goal is reached, circle the tick, this allows you see the link between **deep work** hours and results.

Do a weekly review to plan for the week ahead.

Shut down your mind at the end of the work day. If you need to work more, then just extend your workday. When you finish work for the day, you're finished. No checking email or anything work related.

Downtime aids insights. It restores your ability to redirect your attention by giving this activity (work) a rest. The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important anyway, and your capacity for **deep work** per day is limited to around 4 hours.

Your daily shutdown ritual should involve:

- Add number of **deep work** ticks to the calendar
- Review every incomplete task and either plan for its completion or store in a place to be revisted when the time is right
- Final look at work email
- Write down new tasks that cmae up during the day to master task list
- Scan for upcoming deadlines
- Make rough plan for the next day
- Say "shutdown complete"

Incomplete tasks dominate your attention, however instead of completing the task you can plan how you finish the task.

# Distraction

Don't take breaks from distraction, take breaks from focus. Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction to focus, you should be scheduling the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction.

Schedule what times you'll allow for distraction. Write them down in your daily plan. By minimizing the number of times you give in to distraction you strengthen the attention seeking muscles of your brain. It doesn't matter how long or how many distraction breaks you have, just that in your focused time you don't give in to distraction.

Keep up the focus schedule even outside of work times. Obviously, don't do actual work, but when you want to focus on something (like reading a book), just make sure you don't break a focus block once you've entered it.

# Thinking

Practice *productive meditation*. When you are physically occupied, but not mentally (think running/cleaning), focus on a work problem.

Use *mindfulness meditation* techniques to keep your attention focused. When a distraction appears, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later.

Don't get stuck *looping*, rethinking parts of the problem you have already covered. Notice when you're looping and then redirect your attention to the next step.

Structure your deep thinking by storing relevant variables in memory and define the specific next step question you need to answer using these variables. Then assume you can answer/solve this question and define the following next step question.

# Goals

How do you decide which core factors are important to you? Depends on your high level personal and professional goals.

How do you know what your goals are? Figure out who you are trying to be. That is, who you want to be, not who you should be. Have a vision for your life that justifies your effort.

Always specify your goals, don't be afraid of failing time.

My personal goals:

- Stress-free work-life balance
- Keep a consistent schedule
- Plenty of reading
- Look after my mental health
- Look after my physical health

My professional goals:

- Publish research
- Publish semi-formal blog posts
- Improve programming skills

Now decide on the important activites which allow you to achieve each goals. Think about activites that if you did daily for the next 10 years, would drastically improve your life.

My personal activities:

- Only work within certain hours
- Wake up early enough so I can get sufficient work done
- Do not lie in bed on social media
- Plan week schedule in advance
- Set aside time to read every night before sleeping
- Read every day
- Meditate every day
- Go to the gym
- Get enough sleep every night

My professional activities:

- Skim at least 1 research paper every day
- Plan in advance what I will read the next day
- Program every day
- Implement research papers
- Try and implement 1 paper per week
- Implement own ideas
- Implement data structures and algorithms
- Write every day
- Plan blog posts
- Draft blog posts

# Tools

Avoid the *any benefit* mindset, which tries to justify using a tool if it has any single benefit at all, ignoring all of the negatives. 

Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool if and only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweight its negative impacts.

Now for each tool you consider, for all of the activities decide if it gives a positive, negative or negligible impact on them. Only use a tool if it has positive impacts and these outweight the negative impacts.

You may be thinkng it's silly to put away a tool if it offers a little benefit (but not a lot). Remeber the 80/20 rule, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. You need to focus on the important activites as these will have the biggest gains per time spent, so ignore the 80% of activities that give you 20% of the return.

Another way to decide if you need a tool or not is to put it "away" for a week. If you haven't used it for a week, then you don't need it. This stops you holding on to stuff you think you might need in the future.

# Lesure Time

Be more productive in your leisure time by planning it out in advance. Plan how you want to spend your spare time. Pointless browsing of the internet is an attention sink and sucks up all of your leisure time.

Worried that this sucks the fun out of your leisure time? It will actually make you feel better as you will get more done in your free time.

When you waste an hour doing nothing, ask yourself "was that hour worth my time?"

# Scheduling

Schedule every minute of your day. Open a notebook page each day and down the left-hand side on every other line write an hour of the day, covering every hour you plan to work. Divide the working hours into blocks. Assign activities into blocks. Leave blocks for lunch and breaks. The minimum sized block should be a single line (30 mins). Group very short and similar tasks into a single block and use the right-hand side of the page to write what they are.

It will be difficult to schedule at first, but start with an idealistic schedule of your best possible day. Even if you only achieve 50% of that schedule, it's better than 0%. The next day, try and achieve 51% and keep that going.

Whenever your schedule goes off track, say from an interruption or a task running over schedule, on the next opportunity create a revised schedule. Don't worry about having to revise multiple times, the aim isn't to have a perfect schedule but to plan what your next action is.

You will almost always underestimate how long things take at first. Use overflow blocks. These blocks are optional extra time to finish a task, if you finish your task early and don't use up the overflow block, or finish midway through an overflow block, you can fill time with optional non-essential tasks.

Still allow for spontaneity within your work. This allows you to push your whole schedule back until the new insight is dealt with.

This isn't about rigorous timekeeping, it's about thoughtfulness. It makes you gain a simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment in your day to ask what you should do with your remaining time.

Scheduling your day also helps you determine how much time you're actually spending on shallow activities.

# Fixed Schedule Productivity

Stop working at a certain time of day, or only work a certain hours per week. Do not work after this time is over for the day/week. Within your your set amount of hours, now work on a way to get the amount of work you want to do within your allowed time.

A commitment to fixed schedule productivity shifts your mindset to where you cut out the "fat" (time-wasting aspects of work).
