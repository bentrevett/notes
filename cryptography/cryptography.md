# Cryptography

Cryptography is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of an adversary.

Most commonly, it focuses on algorithms that can encrypt plaintext into cyphertext and also decypt the cyphertext back into plaintext. A cypher is a pair of algorithms for encrypting and decrypting. The cypher uses the plaintext and a key to generate the cyphertext. Similarly the cypher can only decrypt the cyphertext back into the plaintext with the corresponding key. There are two kinds of cypher systems, symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric systems use the same key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric systems use a public key to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt a message.

The simplest encryption technique is the Caesar cipher. Followed by the Vigenere cipher.

The common symmetric system is [[AES]] and the most common asymmetric system is [[RSA]].
