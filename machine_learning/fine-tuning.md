# Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is where you take a pre-trained model (see [[pre-training]]), trained on task $A$ and then train this model on task $B$, however the pre-trained parameters of the model remain fixed to their pre-trained values.

Adapting the pre-trained parameters is called [[transfer_learning]].
