# Semi-supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning falls somewhere between [[supervised_learning]] and [[unsupervised_learning]].

It considers the scenario where you have a large amount of unlabelled data but only a small amount of labelled data.

The common task is to perform [[representation_learning]] on the unlabelled data for [[pre-training]] models to be applied, with [[fine-tuning]] or [[transfer_learning]] on the labelled data.
