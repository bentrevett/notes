# Neural Machine Translation

Neural machine translation (NMT) is the task of translating from one natural language to another using a [[neural_network]]. 

Common architectures are [[recurrent_neural_network]] models such as the [[LSTM]] or the [[GRU]] with [[attention]], though [[transformer]] models are now rising in popularity.

Most NMT models use the [[encoder-decoder]] architecture.
