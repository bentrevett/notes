# Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) involves using computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Common areas of research in NLP are:

- [[text_classification]] (commonly [[sentiment_analysis]])
- [[neural_machine_translation]]
- [[language_modelling]]
- [[natural_language_understanding]]
- [[natural_language_generation]]
- [[part-of-speech_tagging]]
- [[named_entity_recognition]]
- [[question_answering]]
- [[summarization]]
