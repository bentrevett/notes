# Machine Learning

The three main branches of machine learning are:

- [[supervised_learning]]
- [[unsupervised_learning]]
- [[reinforcement_learning]]
- [[natural_language_processing]]
- [[computer_vision]]

There are also:

- [[semi-supervised_learning]]
- [[self-supervised_learning]]

Common areas for machine learning algorithms:

- [[natural_language_processing]]
- [[computer_vision]]
- [[generative_modelling]]
