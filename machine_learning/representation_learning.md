# Representation Learning

Representation learning is the act of learning representations of input data, usually by transforming or extracting features from the input data.

[[neural_network]] models inherently perform representation by transforming the input data after each layer. However, most commonly representation learning is talked about in terms of performing [[unsupervised_learning]] for [[pre-training]] a model to learn good representations which can be adapted for a downstream task in [[fine-tuning]] or [[transfer_learning]].
