# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) uses [[machine_learning]] to teach an [[agent]] to interact with an [[environment]] in order to maximize a scalar [[reward]] value. The key difference from [[supervised_learning]] is that the model/agent itself acts within an environment, thus having an impact on what examples it sees in the future.

RL is usually modelled as a [[markov_decision_process]].

Most commonly when we talk about RL nowadays we mean [[deep_reinforcement_learning]] (DRL), which is just using RL algorithms with [[deep_learning]].

A common problem faced by RL, especially DRL, is [[sample_efficiency]].

There is quite a lot of terminology for RL:
- [[action]]
- [[actor-critic]]
- [[advantage_function]]
- [[agent]]
- [[bellman_equation]]
- [[credit_assignment_problem]]
- [[deadly_triad]]
- [[discount_factor]]
- [[environment]]
- [[experience_replay]]
- [[exploration]]
- [[exploitation]]
- [[greedy_policy]]
- [[epsilon-greedy_policy]]
- [[markov_decision_process]]
- [[model-based_reinforcement_learning]]
- [[model-free_reinforcement_learning]]
- [[monte_carlo]]
- [[observation]]
- [[off-policy]]
- [[offline_reinforcement_learning]]
- [[on-policy]]
- [[online_reinforcement_learning]]
- [[policy]]
- [[policy_gradient]]
- [[Q-learning]]
- [[Q-value]]
- [[return]]
- [[reward]]
- [[state]]
- [[temporal_difference_learning]]
- [[trajectory]]
- [[transition]]
- [[value_function]]

Some notable algorithms are:
- [[REINFORCE]]
- [[A2C]]
- [[A3C]]
- [[TRPO]]
- [[PPO]]
- [[DQN]]
- [[world_models]]
- [[AlphaGo]]
- [[AlphaGo_Zero]]
- [[AlphaZero]]
