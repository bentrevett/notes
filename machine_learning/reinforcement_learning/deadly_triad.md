# Deadly Triad

The deadly triad are three concepts in [[reinforcement_learning]] when using [[temporal_difference_learning]] which, when combined, make it difficult for RL algorithms to converge.

The concepts are:

- [[bootstrapping]]
- [[off-policy]]
- function approximation, i.e. [[deep_reinforcement_learning]]
