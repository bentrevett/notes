# Notes

My personal [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) notes in plain text. The notes are created using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but should be compatible with any markdown rendering tool.

Also requires [markdown+math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) to display equations.
