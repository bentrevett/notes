# Notes

My personal [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) notes in plain text. The notes are created in VSCode with [vscode-memo](https://github.com/svsool/vscode-memo), but should be compatible with any markdown rendering note-taking tool, such as [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Also requires [markdown+math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) to display equations.
