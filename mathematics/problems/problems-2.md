If 1.5 chickens lay 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days How many eggs can 3 chicken lay in 2 days?

Each chicken lays 2/3 of an egg per day.
2/3 * 3 * 2 = 4.

1.5 chickens can lay 1.5 eggs in 1.5 days. Therefore 1.5 chickens can lay (1.5/1.5) 1 egg in 1 day. Three (1.5x2) chickens can lay 2 (1x2) eggs in 1 day. Three chickens can lay 4 (2x2) eggs in 2 days.
