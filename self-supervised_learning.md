# Self-supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning is a technique where you perform [[supervised_learning]], but the labels for your data are automatically obtained.

For example, given a set of unlabelled images randomly rotate them between 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees, then use these 4 possible rotations as labels for a supervised learning model.

This is commonly used for [[representation_learning]] for [[pre-training]] models for [[fine-tuning]] or [[transfer_learning]].
